# - Find NetCDF
# Find the native NetCDF includes and library
#
#  NetCDF_INCLUDE_DIR  - user modifiable choice of where netcdf headers are
#  NetCDF_LIBRARY      - user modifiable choice of where netcdf libraries are
#
# Your package can require certain interfaces to be FOUND by setting these
#
#  NetCDF_CXX         - require the C++ interface and link the C++ library
#  NetCDF_F77         - require the F77 interface and link the fortran library
#  NetCDF_F90         - require the F90 interface and link the fortran library
#
# Or equivalently by calling FindNetCDF with a COMPONENTS argument containing one or
# more of "CXX;F77;F90".
#
# When interfaces are requested the user has access to interface specific hints:
#
#  NetCDF_${LANG}_INCLUDE_DIR - where to search for interface header files
#  NetCDF_${LANG}_LIBRARY     - where to search for interface libraries
#
# This module returns these variables for the rest of the project to use.
#
#  NetCDF_FOUND          - True if NetCDF found including required interfaces (see below)
#  NetCDF_LIBRARIES      - All netcdf related libraries.
#  NetCDF_INCLUDE_DIRS   - All directories to include.
#  NetCDF_HAS_INTERFACES - Whether requested interfaces were found or not.
#  NetCDF_${LANG}_INCLUDE_DIRS/NetCDF_${LANG}_LIBRARIES - C/C++/F70/F90 only interface
#
# Normal usage would be:
#  set (NetCDF_F90 "YES")
#  find_package (NetCDF REQUIRED)
#  target_link_libraries (uses_everthing ${NetCDF_LIBRARIES})
#  target_link_libraries (only_uses_f90 ${NetCDF_F90_LIBRARIES})
