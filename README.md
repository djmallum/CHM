# The Canadian Hydrological Model 
The Canadian Hydrological Model (CHM) is a novel modular unstructured mesh based approach for hydrological modelling. It can move between spatial scale, temporal scale, and spatial extents. It is designed for developing and testing process representations for hydrological models. 

This repository is a fork of the main CHM repo. The main repo can be found [here] which has more complete documentation. Alternatively, one can instead look at the develop branch which has the original README file and links to the documentation.
